	<h2>Geography</h2>
	<p>The borough of Harrow overall has a leafy, suburban character, much of which is a legacy of it being at the centre of the Metroland developments of the early 20th century. The town centre is about 220 feet (67 m) above sea level, almost 200 feet (61 m) below the top of Harrow Hill, which is an outlying knoll. The hill is half a mile south of the town centre, and the settlement is rich with historic architecture and has a village atmosphere. The steep climb towards the hill is clearly visible from Lowlands Road. Other parts of Harrow are not as affluent but are still mostly leafy, particularly the northern part called Harrow Weald. The rural northern slopes of Harrow, around Harrow Weald Common, are part of the Green Belt and contain a conservation area and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) adjacent to another SSSI called Bentley Priory Nature Reserve which comes under Stanmore. The area also has the highest elevation in Harrow, as high as 492 feet (150 m) above sea level.</p>

	<h2>Culture</h2>
	<p> The first and only contemporary artist-led gallery and studios in Harrow was set up in 2010 by the Usurp Art Collective. The space is called the Usurp Art Gallery & Studios and is based in West Harrow, a bohemian part of Harrow. Usurp Art provides professional support to artists, cultural programmes and runs the only public artists studios in the borough. It is a flagship project for Arts Council England. The borough formerly also hosted an annual Harrow Arts Festival. The borough's Harrow Arts Centre is located in Pinner. The Safari Cinema on Station Road showcases mostly Bollywood films since 1995. The building was originally a cinema called Dominion and opened in 1936. Later purchased by ABC Cinemas, the Dominion's original art deco design was covered in new metal cladding in 1962. It was not until January 2020 when plans to restore the art deco (and building 78 flats at the site) was approved by Harrow's council.</p>
